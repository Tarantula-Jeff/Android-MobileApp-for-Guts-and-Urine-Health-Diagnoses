This is an Android Mobile Application, integrated with a Machine Learning Models(ml) i built for diagnosing urine and gastrointestinal health using urine and stool samples of the user  and will send
an urgent notice message to their personal doctor if critical attention is needed, preventing more dire health problems in the future.
This is done by taking a picture sample using the application on the android device, and the trained ml model integrated would do the diagnoses. The ml modeLs were trained by me using a CNN model.
It works but not quiet good since i require more datasets and also i am still working on improving the accuracy of my ml models. The ml models can be in the ml folder if you want to use it though.
The android applicatinion was built solely on java but the ml model in python. I have also built a chatbot solely for the urine and gastro-intestinal health enquiries or consultation which uses
openAI API language model embeddings and integrated it into the application. All is left for you is to log in and try out the application.
